                        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
                        <p>Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle Henry, who was a
                            farmer,
                            and Aunt Em, who was the farmer's wife. Their house was small, for the lumber to build
                            it
                            had to be carried by wagon many miles. There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which
                            made
                            one room; and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard for the dishes,
                            a
                            table, three or four chairs, and the beds. Uncle Henry and Aunt Em had a big bed in one
                            corner, and Dorothy a little bed in another corner. There was no garret at all, and no
                            cellar--except a small hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family
                            could go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to crush any
                            building in
                            its path. It was reached by a trap door in the middle of the floor, from which a ladder
                            led
                            down into the small, dark hole.</p>
                        <p>When Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see nothing but the great
                            gray
                            prairie on every side. Not a tree nor a house broke the broad sweep of flat country that
                            reached to the edge of the sky in all directions. The sun had baked the plowed land into
                            a
                            gray mass, with little cracks running through it. Even the grass was not green, for the
                            sun
                            had burned the tops of the long blades until they were the same gray color to be seen
                            everywhere. Once the house had been painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the
                            rains
                            washed it away, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else.</p>

                    <div class="right-column">
                        <p>When Aunt Em came there to live she was a young, pretty wife. The sun and wind had
                            changed
                            her, too. They had taken the sparkle from her eyes and left them a sober gray; they had
                            taken the red from her cheeks and lips, and they were gray also. She was thin and gaunt,
                            and
                            never smiled now. When Dorothy, who was an orphan, first came to her, Aunt Em had been
                            so
                            startled by the child's laughter that she would scream and press her hand upon her heart
                            whenever Dorothy's merry voice reached her ears; and she still looked at the little girl
                            with wonder that she could find anything to laugh at.</p>
                        <p>Uncle Henry never laughed. He worked hard from morning till night and did not know what
                            joy
                            was. He was gray also, from his long beard to his rough boots, and he looked stern and
                            solemn, and rarely spoke. It was Toto that made Dorothy laugh, and saved her from
                            growing as
                            gray as her other surroundings. Toto was not gray; he was a little black dog, with long
                            silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on either side of his funny, wee
                            nose.
                            Toto played all day long, and Dorothy played with him, and loved him dearly.</p>
